### 1. What NoSQL Means

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It is a category of database management systems that do not follow the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) principles. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, often in a distributed fashion, and are optimized for various data models such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph.

### 2. Difference Between SQL and NoSQL

**SQL (Relational Databases)**:

- **Structure**: Schema-based, tables with rows and columns.
- **Query Language**: Structured Query Language (SQL).
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures transactions are processed reliably.
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle Database.

**NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)**:

- **Structure**: Schema-less, flexible data models (key-value, document, column-family, graph).
- **Query Language**: Varies by database, often no standard query language.
- **BASE Compliance**: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.
- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.

### 3. What is ACID

ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are properties of relational database transactions.

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that each transaction is all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions occur independently without interference.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

### 4. What is Document Storage

Document storage is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as documents, typically in formats like JSON or BSON (Binary JSON). Each document can contain complex data structures and nested fields.

### 5. NoSQL Types

- **Key-Value Stores**: Data is stored as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
- **Document Stores**: Data is stored as documents (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
- **Column-Family Stores**: Data is stored in columns rather than rows (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
- **Graph Databases**: Data is stored as nodes and edges, representing relationships (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

### 6. Benefits of a NoSQL Database

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale out horizontally.
- **Flexibility**: Schema-less, allowing for flexible data models.
- **Performance**: Optimized for specific data models and access patterns.
- **Distributed Computing**: Often designed to work in distributed environments.

### 7. How to Query Information from a NoSQL Database

The query methods vary depending on the type of NoSQL database. For document stores like MongoDB, querying is done using a query language or API specific to that database.

#### Example in MongoDB:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ field: "value" });
```

### 8. How to Insert/Update/Delete Information from a NoSQL Database

The operations for inserting, updating, and deleting data vary by database. Hereâ€™s an example using MongoDB:

#### Insert:

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ field: "value" });
```

#### Update:

```javascript
db.collection.updateOne({ field: "value" }, { $set: { field: "new_value" } });
```

#### Delete:

```javascript
db.collection.deleteOne({ field: "value" });
```

### 9. How to Use MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Here are the basic steps to use MongoDB:

1. **Install MongoDB**: Download and install MongoDB from the official website.
2. **Start the MongoDB Server**: Run the `mongod` command to start the MongoDB server.
3. **Use the MongoDB Shell or Driver**: Interact with MongoDB using the MongoDB shell (`mongo`) or a driver for your programming language.

#### Example of Basic Operations:

- **Connect to MongoDB Shell**:
  ```shell
  mongo
  ```
- **Create a Database**:
  ```javascript
  use mydatabase
  ```
- **Create a Collection**:
  ```javascript
  db.createCollection("mycollection");
  ```
- **Insert a Document**:
  ```javascript
  db.mycollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });
  ```
- **Find a Document**:
  ```javascript
  db.mycollection.find({ name: "Alice" });
  ```
- **Update a Document**:
  ```javascript
  db.mycollection.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 26 } });
  ```
- **Delete a Document**:
  ```javascript
  db.mycollection.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" });
  ```
